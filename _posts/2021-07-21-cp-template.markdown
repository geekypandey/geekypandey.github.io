## My CP Template

It is always fun to write and maintain your own template file for competitive programming, just like maintaining `.virmc` file.
I primarily program in C++. So here is my cpp template file:

{% gist aebf1361149957fe0b9b3d9eddd0d1d9 %}

Now how to keep improving this template,
1. Experiment with different things, and make it customize to your needs.
2. Look at other people template and learn.

The same thing could be said for editing your `.vimrc` file, that is if you use vim :-)
